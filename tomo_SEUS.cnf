#
# This is an example of configuration file, wherein global paths and parameters
# related to the seismic noise tomography procedure are defined. At least one
# configuration file should reside in the folder in which you intend to run
# your scripts. The configuration file(s) can have any name, as long as the
# extension is 'cnf': e.g., 'tomo.cnf', 'myconfig.cnf', 'test.cnf'...
#
# The parameters are divided in several sections:
# - [paths]             : default paths to input/output folders
# - [maps]              : parameters to plot maps
# - [cross-correlation] : parameters to calculate cross-correlations
# - [FTAN]              : parameters of the frequency-time analysis
# - [tomography]        : parameters of the tomographic inversion
#
# Before using the scripts and package pysismo, you should at least make sure
# that the paths in section [paths] and shapefiles in section [maps] are
# consistent with your own files and folders organization. And, of course, you
# should make sure to set the correct interval of dates to calculate the cross-
# correlations, in section [cross-correlation]. The other parameters can be
# fine-tuned later as you analyze your data.
#
# Module pysismo.psconfig takes care of reading the configuration file and
# defining the global parameters. If only one configuration file (*.cnf) is
# found in the current folder, then psconfig reads it silently. If
# several *.cnf files are found, then you'll be prompted to select one of
# them.
#
# Other modules then import from psconfig the parameters they need, e.g.:
# 
#   from psconfig import CROSSCORR_DIR, FTAN_DIR, PERIOD_BANDS, ...
#
# Note that most of (but not all) the global parameters are actually default 
# values that can be overridden in the functions where they are used. For
# example, ``PERIOD_BANDS`` is the default value of the input argument ``bands`` 
# of the function pscrosscorr.CrossCorrelation.plot_by_period_band(), but you
# can specify other bands by explicitly passing the argument, e.g.: 
# 
#   plot_by_period_band(bands=[[10, 30], [20, 50]])
#
# If, in one script, you want to modify a global parameter without touching
# the configuration file, you must first import psconfig, then modify the
# parameters as desired, and finally import other module(s), e.g.:
#
# >>> from pysismo import psconfig 
# >>> psconfig.FTAN_DIR = 'mydir'
# >>> from pysismo import pscrosscorr
# >>> pscrosscorr.FTAN_DIR
# 'mydir'   # ok the changes have been taken in account
#
# It is strongly discouraged to modify global parameters once psconfig (or a 
# module importing it) has been imported, as the effect can be highly
# imprevisible (immutable default values won't be affected, mutable default
# values can be affected, parameters used as is in the code will be affected).
